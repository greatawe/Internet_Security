cyber crime-criminal activities carried out by means of computers or the Internet.
unpatched vulnerabilities-another term for security vulnerability, a security exploit is an unintended and unpatched flaw in software code that exposes it to potential exploitation by hackers or malicious software code such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other forms of malware.

An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an unauthorized person gains access to a network and stays there undetected for a long period of time. The intention of an APT attack is to steal data rather than to cause damage to the network or organization.
A back door is a means of access to a computer program that bypasses security mechanisms. A programmer may sometimes install a back door so that the program can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes. However, attackers often use back doors that they detect or install themselves, as part of an exploit.
Botnet a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge, e.g. to send spam.
Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies.
Exploit make use of (a situation) in a way considered unfair or underhand.
Key logger a computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user, especially in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.
Logic bomb a set of instructions secretly incorporated into a program so that if a particular condition is satisfied they will be carried out, usually with harmful effects.
Macro virus is a computer virus that "infects" a Microsoft Word or similar application and causes a sequence of actions to be performed automatically when the application is started or something else triggers it. Macro viruses tend to be surprising but relatively harmless.
Port scan *tabjacking is a series of messages sent by someone attempting to break into a computer to learn which computer network services, each associated with a "well-known" port number, the computer provides. Port scanning, a favorite approach of computer cracker, gives the assailant an idea where to probe for weaknesses. Essentially, a port scan consists of sending a message to each port, one at a time. The kind of response received indicates whether the port is used and can therefore be probed for weakness.
Ransomware a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.
Rootkit is a type of malicious software that is activated each time your system boots up. Rootkits are difficult to detect because they are activated before your system's Operating System has completely booted up.
A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. Unlike a computer virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program.
Zero day deriving from or relating to a previously unknown vulnerability to attack in some software.
Zombie is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse program and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.
